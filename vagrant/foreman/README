# Linux specifics:

In order to get this working under Linux/Fedora, I had to do the following:

# dnf install ruby-devel 
# dnf install vagrant-sshfs
# dnf install vagrant-libvirt

# vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf

I also had to make some heavy modifications to the Vagrantfile

The file should now be seperated into specific dependencies for Virtualbox
and for libvirt.

The 'foremanstrap.sh' file was modified to copy files from the host-mount
to the appropriate location (rather than modifying the host files directly.) 

I.e. the following entries:

#    sudo  cp -R /modules/* /etc/puppet/modules/
#    sudo  cp -R /environment/* /etc/puppet/hieradata/environment/
#    sudo  cp -R /common/* /etc/puppet/hieradata/common/

This is because libvirt uses sshfs to make mounting of host dir's easier.
